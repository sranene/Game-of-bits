# Game of bits

This Board Game is a digital adaptation of the traditional Portuguese game “Jogo da Glória,” created to apply object-oriented programming concepts and implement unit testing with JUnit. This project was developed as part of the **Linguagens de Programação II 2021 course at Lusófona Informática**.

## Gameplay

At launch, players can choose between 2 to 4 participants. Each game board is generated randomly, so the arrangement of spaces changes every time. Players take turns rolling a dice to advance across the board.  

The board is divided into two sections:  

1. **Early section:** Players may land on special spaces that provide **tools** to protect themselves from negative effects on later spaces.  
2. **Later section:** Players encounter **challenge spaces** with consequences, such as moving back a number of spaces. However, if a player possesses the correct tool, they can avoid the penalty.  

The ultimate goal is to reach the end of the board first.
